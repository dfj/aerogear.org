title: AeroGear 1.2.0 is out!

---

We're happy like the reindeers leading Santa to the North Pole to announce the immediate availability of **AeroGear 1.2.0**

## Data encryption

Security is not a one-man job, it is something which must be built closer to the community feedback and improved, otherwise it can turn into a recipe for disaster. For this reason the December release of AeroGear was mostly focused around _local data encryption_ for Android, iOS and JavaScript.

The major goal was to make cryptography a subject easy for humans to understand, not only specialists or mathematicians. We know this is a delicate topic with overcomplicated API's that have been haunting most developers for years.

### API symmetry 

The [AeroGear Crypto API](http://staging.aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-crypto/) was designed with developers in mind, we don't want to push complexity if you're just trying to encrypt data. Initially we've added support for PBKDF2, AES with GCM/CBC modes and also created 3 projects:

* AeroGear Crypto Java compatible with Android and JEE applications.
* AeroGear iOS Crypto
* AeroGear Crypto JS

## Android 

## Cordova

## iOS

## JavaScript

## SimplePush
